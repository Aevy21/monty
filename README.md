# Project Title: 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Overview
This repository is a collaborative effort focused on implementing algorithms and data structures related to stacks and queues in the C programming language. The primary goal is to delve into the concepts of Last In, First Out (LIFO) and First In, First Out (FIFO), exploring their applications in various scenarios.

## Introduction to Stacks and Queues
In the realm of algorithmic problem-solving, understanding stacks and queues is pivotal. This project explores the fundamental concepts of these data structures, providing insights into their applications and implementations.

## Understanding LIFO and FIFO
- **LIFO (Last In, First Out):** Items are added and removed from the same end, resembling a stack of plates. The last item added is the first one to be removed.
- **FIFO (First In, First Out):** Items are added at one end and removed from the other, akin to a queue in a line. The item that has been in the queue the longest is the first to be removed.

## Stacks: When and How to Use
A stack is appropriate when you need to manage data in a last-in, first-out fashion. It is commonly used for function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.

## Queues: When and How to Use
Queues are ideal for scenarios where data must be processed in a first-in, first-out order. They find applications in breadth-first search, task scheduling, and handling requests in networking.

## Common Implementations
Common implementations of stacks include arrays and linked lists. Queues are often implemented using arrays or linked lists as well. The choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.

## Use Cases
Stacks and queues are prevalent in diverse applications. Stacks are employed in undo mechanisms, parsing expressions, and managing function calls. Queues find use in print job scheduling, task management, and asynchronous data processing.

## Proper Use of Global Variables
While global variables can be convenient, their use should be judicious. Reserve global variables for values shared across multiple functions, ensuring they are well-documented and appropriately named to maintain code clarity.

Feel free to explore the codebase and documentation to gain a deeper understanding of the project and its implementations. Contributions and feedback are highly appreciated.
